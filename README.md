## Greg's album collection
A rest API for managing all of Greg's records

### Use
search all of Greg's albums in paginated fashion with the 'limit' and 'offset' params
```
GET localhost:3000/api/v1/albums?limit=100&offset=30000
```
returns an array of 100 albums offset by 30000 with their associated artist

If no params are given, a default of 10 albums will be returned with 0 offset

Greg's albums can also be searched by album title with a 'search' param. For example:
```
GET localhost:3000/api/v1/albums?search=os
```
will return albums with 'os' anywhere in their title (case insensitive)

these params can also be combined with the limit and offset
```
GET localhost:3000/api/v1/albums?limit=1000&offset=0&search='Ja'
```

Greg's albums can also be updated like so:

```
PATCH localhost:3000/api/v1/albums/33

{
        "id": 33,
        "album_title": "no longer jada",
        "condition": "rough",
        "year": 1957,
        "artist": {
            "id": 19,
            "name": "Erin",
            "created_at": "2021-03-17T23:41:09.344Z",
            "updated_at": "2021-03-17T23:41:09.344Z"
        }
}
```
![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/chadellison/gregs_record_collection/master/public/update_album.png)

The album_title, condition, year, and artist's name fields can all be updated

We can also add to Greg's albums like so:

```
POST localhost:3000/api/v1/albums

{
    "album_title": "this new thing",
    "condition": "excellent",
    "year": 1965,
    "artist": {
        "name": "unknown"
    }
}
```
![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/chadellison/gregs_record_collection/master/public/create_album.png)

additions must have a unique combination of album_title and artist name

For example, if we try to create the same album twice we will get a 422 error:

We can also view the most commonly used words from the album titles across the entire collection
```
GET localhost:3000/api/v1/words
```
returns an array of the 10 most commonly used words and their respective counts

We can also see the number of albums an artist released each each year with the following:

```
GET localhost:3000/api/v1/artists/807
```

###To run the application locally:
run the following commands from the command line

```
git clone https://github.com/chadellison/gregs_record_collection.git
```
run bundle
```
bundle
```

create the database
```
rake db:create
```

run the migrations
```
rake db:migrate
```

run the seed file
```
rake db:seed
```
the seed file will load 1000 artists and 100_000 albums
this should finish in less than a minute

Since we know Greg will have 1 million albums any day now, we can update
the seed file to write 1 million albums to the database (this should take roughly 7 minutes)

key word searches across the entire album collection should still be sub 500 ms üëç

the server can be started with ```rails s```

the test suite can be run with ```rspec```

ruby version 2.7.1
